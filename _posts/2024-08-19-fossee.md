<p><a href="https://fossee.in/">FOSSEE</a> stands for 'Free/Libre and Open Source Software for Education'. It is a project by Government of India to promote open source tools in acedemia and research. They support many open source tools like Scilab, OpenModelica, OpenPLC, OpenFOAM, eSim and others.</p>


<p>During the summer of 2022, after my third year at VJTI, I got selected for FOSSEE Summer Fellowship. I worked on OpenFOAM which is used for Computational Fluid Dynamics <a href="https://cfd.fossee.in/">(CFD).</a> The selection criteria was to solve and a screening task in 10 days. The task was to solve a simple 2D problem using OpenFOAM.</p>

<p>The internship started in May and ended in July. It was entirely virtual because of covid. My primary mentor was <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/prnarenportal">Dr. P R Naren</a>. Additionally, weekly meetings were conducted with <a href="https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/faculty/prof-janani-srree-murallidharan"> J S Murallidharan</a> who is the Principal Investigator of the FOSSEE CFD Group.</p>

<p>The work assigned to me was to study the fluid dynamics of bifurcation and implement k-epsilon turbulence model on a Y-splitter. The geometry was created in FreeCad and meshed using snappyhexmesh utility in Openfoam. Pimplefoam solver was used to solve the transient RANS turbulence model.</p>
