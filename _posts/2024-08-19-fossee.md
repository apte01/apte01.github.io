<a href="https://fossee.in/">FOSSEE</a> stands for 'Free/Libre and Open Source Software for Education'. It is a project by Government of India to promote open source tools in acedemia and research. They support many open source tools like Scilab, OpenModelica, OpenPLC, OpenFOAM, eSim and others.


During the summer of 2022, after my third year at VJTI, I got selected for FOSSEE Summer Fellowship. I worked on OpenFOAM which is used for Computational Fluid Dynamics <a href="https://cfd.fossee.in/">(CFD).</a> The selection criteria was to solve and a screening task in 10 days. The task was to solve a simple 2D problem using OpenFOAM.

The internship started in May and ended in July. It was entirely virtual because of covid. My primary mentor was <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/prnarenportal">Dr. P R Naren</a>. Additionally, weekly meetings were conducted with <a href="https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/faculty/prof-janani-srree-murallidharan"> J S Murallidharan</a> who is the Principal Investigator of the FOSSEE CFD Group.
